      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        This delicious meal is best made with old rice to ensure low moisture in the final product. This recipe makes a lot of food, 
        but fried rice reheats well, making this a good meal prep candidate!
      </p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1 1/2 cups of dry rice (2 scoops of most rice cooker cups), cooked a day prior and kept overnight in the refrigerator</li>
        <li>1/4 cup of butter</li>
        <li>3 tbsp of sesame cooking oil</li>
        <li>32 oz. of frozen vegetables (I prefer a mix of peas, corn, and carrots)</li>
        <li>4 cloves of garlic; minced</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>Soy Sauce to taste</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>In a large pan over medium-high heat, add 1 tbsp of sesame oil and the frozen vegetables.
             Cook until vegetables are thawed and then add the minced garlic. Continue to cook until vegetables are soft and tender.</li>
        <li>Remove vegetables from pan.</li>
        <li> Melt 1 tbsp of butter in the pan. Once melted, crack the eggs directly into the pan. 
            Season the eggs with salt and pepper and then scramble until they are thoroughly cooked.</li>
        <li>Remove eggs from pan.</li>
        <li>Melt remaining butter in pan. Add the rice and stir to coat.</li>
        <li>Fry the rice until almost all remaining moisture is gone and it starts to crisp up.</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce until desired flavor is achieved.</li>
        <li>Return vegetables and eggs to pan with rice, add remaining sesame oil and heat throughout.</li>
        <li>Serve!</li>
      </ol>
