      </p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>1/2 lb of any pasta (preferably spaghetti like)</li>
        <li>6 oz. of bacon</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>4 oz. Pecorino Romano grated</li>
        <li>4 oz. Parmigiano Reggiano grated</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>2 cloves of garlic</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot filled with water to a boil. Add salt.</li>
        <li>Begin boiling pasta according to package instructions. 
          Make sure to reserve about 1/2 cup of pasta water when you finish boiling the pasta.</li>
          <li>In a bowl: mix together eggs, egg yolks, black pepper, and 3/4 of the grated cheese.</li>
        <li>Place bacon cut into about 1/2 inch pieces into a cold pan. Turn on burner to medium heat and fry until desired doneness.
          About 2 minutes before bacon is done cooking, add sliced garlic to pan to cook and crisp.</li>
        <li>Remove bacon and garlic from pan, but leave the bacon grease.</li>
        <li>Add strained pasta to the pan and toss to coat in the bacon grease. Turn off the stove and remove the pan from the heat.</li>
        <li>With the pan off the burner, add the egg slurry mixture to the pasta and quickly stir to ensure the eggs don't set.
          The remaining heat will cook the eggs.</li>
        <li>Slowly add the reserved pasta water until the sauce reaches the desire texture: smooth and glossy.</li>
        <li>Return the bacon and garlic to the pasta mix together, add salt to taste, and serve immediately.</li>
      </ol>
